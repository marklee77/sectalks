========================

There are some files in this directory in novel executable formats: HOI, KRL,
NUO, QXR and TAU. To run these programs on your ELF-compatible system you
will need a binary translator. Two of these translators have been provided,
to execute the rest of the programs you will need to figure out how to create
your own translation programs for the remaining files.
